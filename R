# Create example data
# Independent variable (predictor)
x <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10)

# Dependent variable (response)
y <- c(2, 4, 5, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10)

# Create a dataframe
data <- data.frame(x, y)

# Fit a linear regression model
model <- lm(y ~ x, data = data)

# Print the summary of the model to see results

# Plot the data and the regression line

Explanation:
Data creation: The example dataset consists of independent variable x and dependent variable y.
lm() function: This function is used to fit a linear model in R. Here, y ~ x specifies that we want to model y as a function of x.
summary(): Displays the details of the fitted model, including coefficients, R-squared value, and statistical significance.
Plotting: The plot() function creates a scatter plot of the data, and abline() adds the regression line to the plot.
The output will show the slope (coefficient) and intercept of the linear regression line, along with the statistical significance of the model.
